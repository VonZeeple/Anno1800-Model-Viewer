# ANNO 1800 Asset viewer

This program displays .cfg and rdm files from the game Anno 1800. The goal is to provide a visual feedback for modders while editing theses files (check props position/orientation for example).

## Disclaimer:
This program is a WIP. Some files are displayed with bugs, or not parsed at all.

## How to use:
At the moment you need a python distribution (at least python 3.7). 
You can download vanilla python here:
https://www.python.org/

Anaconda is also great if you want to do science related stuff in future project:
https://www.anaconda.com/

You will also need to resolve some depenencies by downloading following packages (most recent versions):

- wxPython
- pyOpengl
- pillow
- lxml

Then using cmd, go to the folder containing main.py and run: python main.py
